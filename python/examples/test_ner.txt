We tested the in vivo PK/BBB profiles of 7,8-DHF and R13 after dosing R13 in six mice. Three animals in group 1 were dosed orally with 7,8-DHF at 50 mg/kg, and three animals in group 2 were dosed orally with R13 at 36 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected from all animals up to 8 h after dosing. Concentrations of 7,8-DHF in the plasma samples were determined using LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a noncompartmental method. Following a single oral administration of R13 at a dose of 36 mg/kg, the mean Cmax and Tmax values for 7,8-DHF were 129 ng/mL and 30 min, respectively, and the mean area under the curve (AUC) (0-t) value was 11,880 min ng/mL. The mean value of oral bioavailability for R13 was 10.5%. (SI Appendix, Table S6). Notably, 7,8-DHF T1/2 released from R13 was 219.6 min versus 134 min by parent compound, indicating the prodrug can sustainably release 7,8-DHF in the circulation system.
